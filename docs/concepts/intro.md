### **GHO is the only decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin native to the Aave Protocol**

GHO (pronounced "go") is a decentralized, over-collateralized stablecoin that is fully backed, transparent and native to the Aave Protocol. As a decentralized stablecoin, GHO is minted by users on demand, subject to mint cap limitations set up by Aave's governance. GHOâ€™s value is programmatically aligned to the U.S. Dollar, which is maintained through market efficiency.

As with all borrowing on the Aave Protocol, a user must supply collateral (at a specific collateral ratio) to be able to mint GHO. Correspondingly, when a user repays a borrow position (or is liquidated), the GHO is returned to the Aave pool and burned. All the interest payments accrued by minters of GHO go directly to the [Aave DAO treasury](https://zapper.fi/daos/aave), in contrast to the standard reserve factor collected when users borrow other assets. Collateral that was used to back GHO is then freed up and can be used to open a new borrow position or be withdrawn.

Since its release in July 2023, GHO's supply has been steadily expanding, reflecting its growing adoption and the increasing trust in its stability and utility within the DeFi ecosystem. This expansion is meticulously monitored by Aave's Governance entities, ensuring that GHO maintains its intended stability and security. Aave Governance plays a crucial role in overseeing adjustments to collateral requirements and other key parameters, allowing GHO to adapt to market conditions while preserving its decentralized nature and robust overcollateralization.

Explore the GHO documentation to understand how it works and why the development of GHO is essential for the broader ecosystem. The [Technical Paper](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/blob/main/techpaper/GHO_Technical_Paper.pdf) and Smart Contracts pages will provide guidance on how to integrate GHO.
